# CanvasAPI-Google-Sheets-Add-on-
Google sheets add-on invoking Canvas LMS API

This project is based on James Jones' Google Sheets script that provides Canvas API functionality for other scripts. 
It is currently under developing and not intended for production usage. Just for FUN!

I am not a fulltime developer. The project will be missing some documentations.

I am using clasp to maintain the project. To see how to use clasp, check https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp.
