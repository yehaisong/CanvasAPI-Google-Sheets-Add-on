# CanvasAPI-Google-Sheets-Add-on-
Google sheets add-on invoking Canvas LMS API

This project is based on James Jones' Google Sheets script that provides Canvas API functionality for other scripts. 
It is currently in developing pharse and not intended for production usage.



I am using clasp to maintain the project. To see how to use clasp, check https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/clasp.
